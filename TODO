Use boost::prt_list instead of std::list where appropriate

Use const when possible, alot of iterators can be const, etc.

Evaluate if some lists are better as vectors or if vectors are better
   as lists.

Make CB_ functions work with std::string and remove all the c_str() calls

Move a lot of things to CB namespace, and maybe change the name of the
   namespace.

Change castings to the least powerful one required.

Make mass AI work again.

Change from UtilsThread to boost::thread as it is an implementaion of
   C++0x threads.

Consider using boost::tuple instead of UtilsCL_Vector.h .

Document and follow the coding standard  in use (check ClanBomber.cpp).

Move all SDL usage to cbe.

Remove all use of SDL_PumpEvents, must use SDL_PollEvent.

Check if CL_Vector really need to have x, y and z as floats.

Is Bomber et al adding themselves to lists a desired side effect?, it
   might turn the code harder to undertard. Analise a leave as it is
   or change to make it cleaner.

Use boost::array, eg in Server and Client.

Extract BomberConfig from GameConfig files to his own file.

Rename Config class to GameConfig.

Check if user is root and if it is, refuse to run, add compile flag to
   disable this behaviour.

Rename .h files to .hpp where code is c++.
