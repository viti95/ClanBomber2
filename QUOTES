We wrote down some funny conversations during working on ClanBomber
--------------------------------------------------------------------


#1	(Denis tweakes the behaviour of falling Bombers)

	Denis: this looks silly somehow
	Andi:  If you jump out of the window, do you care whether it looks good or bad?

#2	(Denis and Andi are sitting in front of their computers)

	Andi: Imagine Magnus calls us via talk and asks whether we made a progress with ClanBomber,
		 we would say "No, we are spraying deodorant spray onto our balls". (we really were)

    You guys are sick! -- mbn

#3      (We were bored)

	Denis: What am I going to say now? 
	Andi: ... ... wrong!
	Denis: right!

#4      (We had a digital camera for one day, and were standing on the streets searching for intresting pictures to take)

	Denis: ...WHAT can we capture now...?
	Andi: Hmmm, we can only capture the THINGS that are here,
		 or we can capture US
		 ...
		 or we can capture US destroying these THINGS.

#5	(Andi does "while true; do play splash?a.wav; done" in clanbomber/wavs)

	Andi: "this would be the sound if we were gay."
	(NOTE: splash1a.wav is Andi's sound and spash2a.wav is Denis' sound)

#6	(Written by Andi and Denis in ClanBomber.h)
	we like profanity in open source software, please read the
	following words
	carefully: fuck, pussy, dick, sperm, motherfucker

	hope our source code will now be censored by all governments
	that suck.
