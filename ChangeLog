2007-10-15 andi
- applied dok's DirectFB patches, following API changes and using batch blits
- fixed a longstanding double free which made Clanbomber2 crash during exit
  under certain conditions

2004-01-13 mass
- write char* instead of CL_String to an ofstream

2004-01-08 mass
- do not display "BACKSPACE: CHAT" in GameStatus* for local games

2004-01-01 andi
- removed dok's title screen (sorry, but he didn't add a "2") :-)
- removed old extras

2003-12-31 mass
- moved lots of code belonging to Chat from Client-/Server-Setup
- do not signal new_message_arrived for autogenerated chat-messages
- use DrawRectangle instead of FillRectangle for signing auto-messages
- installed an observer-hack which repaints the area from which the
  observer starts jumping (until i'll find out what's the problem on
  client-machines...)

2003-12-30 mass
- Andi got the right idea, reordered main-loop like suggested by him
- fixed chat-messages which got shortened by one letter...
- do not send messages consisting of spaces only
+ increased protocol-version again

2003-12-29 mass
- finally fixed _*_THE_*_ virtual-method-called-bug which was caused
  by a misorder in the main act()-loop
+ also to remove from the ClanBomber1 source-tree!
- increased PAUSE_MILLIS_BETWEEN_MAPS used in server's demo-mode
- changed "Player Setup" to "Local Player Setup"

2003-12-28 andi
- make ClanBomber2 run even when FusionSound could not be initialized

2003-12-27 mass
- added an Options-shortcut also to the Client-Setup allowing
  the Client to view all the Options as set by the Server
+ the Options change at the same time the Server sets them
  (looks nice)
+ Graphics-Options are the only Options changable by a Client
+ all other Options cannot be edited by a Client
- reorganized Options a bit again for Local/Server consistency:
+ added "Random Bomber Positions"-Option also to "New Game"-Menu
+ "Random Bomber Positions", "Random Map", "Points To Win" and
  "Round Time" are common Options now which are shared between
  the different Local/Server configurations !!!
- extended menu-hacks to handle all that stuff of course
  and even had to add more of them...
  (uff, all that hacking got really complicated :-(( )
- both Client and Server draw the Setup-Menu behind the Options
  instead of the simple ClanBomber-Titlescreen, so they are able
  to view all selections and (dis-)connections in background
- extended BOMBER_CONFIG-message to transfer additional options
- increased server's protocol-version
- other reorganizations, fixes and improvements 

2003-12-24 andi

2003-12-22 mass
- restructured ServerSetup-Menu:
+ added a shortcut to the Options-Menu and installed a hack in
  Menu which really does what is expected ;)
+ allowed the Server to change all the Options at (game-)run-time!
+ let the Server also set some other urgent options which currently
  were accessible from the "New Game"-Menu only. Duplicated these
  options also for the main Options-Menu:
  ---> 'Points to Win', 'Round Time' and 'Random Map Order' <---
- TODO: add a View-Options shortcut to the Client-Setup, too!

- more Chat implementation and some other stuff
- made all Chat methods stuff static, create Chat once only
- lock Chat methods for synchronized access
- added an utility function which tokenizes a message by spaces
  using index() and automatically breakes the line when the maximum

- added keep-alive message and handling, so dead clients are disconnected
  automatically by the server
- fixed bomb throwing bug (sometimes bombs got greater and greater on clients)
  (fly_dest_x or fly_dest_y are <0 sometimes, but is that ok?
   since only positive values can be put in net-messages, i made them so)
